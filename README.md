# 🧠 Time-Series Analysis of Sales Data With Machine Learning

A practical and research-driven implementation of **multi-step sales forecasting** using **XGBoost** and comparative benchmarking with **ARIMA**. This project demonstrates the application of machine learning for time-series analysis, with a focus on model interpretability, accuracy, and scalability.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project includes:


- Multi-step forecasting using **XGBRegressor** with a **direct-recursive strategy**
- Benchmarking with **ARIMA**
- Evaluation using **MAE** and **RMSE**
- Visual comparison of model performance
- A reproducible Jupyter notebook and Python scripts

---

## 🗃️ Dataset

We use the publicly available **Rossmann Sales Dataset**:
- 📥 [Download it from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/rossmann-store-sales)

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 🔧 Requirements

Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If `requirements.txt` is missing, install manually:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn xgboost statsmodels jupyter
```

---

### 🧪 Run the Notebook

To run the full workflow and compare XGBoost vs ARIMA:

```bash
jupyter notebook sales_forecasting_example.ipynb
```

---

## 📈 Results Summary

| Model    | MAE     | RMSE    |
|----------|---------|---------|
| ARIMA    | 1584.4  | 2123.7  |
| XGBoost  | **1120.3**  | **1535.6**  |

> 🔍 *XGBoost significantly outperformed ARIMA in modeling non-linear sales trends.*

## 🧠 Key Concepts

- **XGBoost**: A tree-based ensemble learning model that handles complex, nonlinear data well.
- **Direct-Recursive Strategy**: A hybrid forecasting strategy that balances prediction accuracy and computational efficiency.
- **Explainability**: Discussed as part of ongoing research directions (e.g., SHAP, feature importance).
